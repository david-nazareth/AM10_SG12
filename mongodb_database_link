To open it in MongoDb you need to:

3. Download MongoDb Database Tools from https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/database-tools
4. Unzip/decompress the folder and put the content (you should have files like mongodump, mongorestore ...) in your MongoDb installation directory:
  - On Windows: C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.4\bin
  - On Mac OS: I'm not sure but should be /usr/local/var/mongodb
5. Add your MongoDb installation directory to your path, to use MongoDb commands from anywhere on your system
6. Download the MongoDb database from the link above, and unzip it
7. Put the unzipped "dump" folder in your Downloads folder
8. Open a terminal and cd to your download folder:
  - On Windows: Press windows logo + R, type "cmd", press ENTER, type "cd Downloads"
  - On Mac: I don't know but should be something similar :)
9. Type the following command: "mongorestore --gzip dump/"
10. Will take some time to load the db, then you can open MongoDb Compass, click "connect" and the data should be there
