# AM10 Final Project- Study Group 12

### Objectives of the project:

National lockdowns and government restrictions in response to COVID-19 grounded commercial airlines in many parts of the world in the first half of 2020. We aim to visualize the impact of COVID-19 on the airline industry by creating a series of static, dynamic and interactive plots. The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. To visualise the impact that the pandemic has had on some major airports and international routes

2. Compare the impact of the pandemic on air traffic to previous crises in the airline industry such as the aftermath of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano eruption in April 2010.

3. Compare the impact that COVID-19 has had on commercial and private traffic 

4. To visualise the impact on vertical flight efficiency and taxi-out time

5. Compare the impact of the first and second wave on flight traffic

### Tools and languages used:

1. Stored data in a MongoDB database
2. Cleaned and analyzed data in Python 
3. Visualized data using Tableau and R

### Visualisations produced:

1. Geospatial interactive map of weekly evolution of COVID-19 cases and air traffic in different regions
2. Geospatial maps with lines showing flights between 21 major European airports and 31 major global airports to visualise the drop in air traffic in late March-early April
3. Bar charts showing percentage change in flight volume along major global routes and in airports across 5 continents
4. Time series plot comparing daily flight volumes in the Eurocontrol area between 2010 (eruption of Eyjafjallajökull) and 2020 (COVID-19)
5. Dynamic bar chart in Tableau showing the increase in the traffic share of private planes during the pandemic
6. Time series plots showing the impact of COVID-19 on vertical flight efficiency
7. Plots of 99% confidence intervals for mean time in level flight during takeoff and landing between 2020, 2019 and 2018
8. Plots of 99% confidence intervals for mean additional taxi-out time between 2020 and 2019
9. Bar plots showing the top airports in Europe that saw the largest decrease in additional taxi-out time compared with 2019's numbers
10. Contrasting the effect of the first and second wave on number of flights through time series plots

### Results of the analysis:

1. Some of the longest and busiest air routes in the world saw flight volumes plummet compared to 2019’s numbers
2. The impact of COVID-19 has been much broader and deeper compared to the 2010 air traffic crisis and flight volumes have not yet recovered
3. Cessna overtook Airbus in terms of share in global air traffic for a brief while in 2020 as passenger flights came to a grinding halt
4. We can take comfort in knowing that the few flights which are still operational are able to taxi-out, take-off and land more efficiently due to clearer skies!
