# AM10 Final Project Proposal- Study Group 12

### Objectives of the project:

National lockdowns and government restrictions in response to COVID-19 grounded commercial airlines in many parts of the world in the first half of 2020. We aim to visualize the impact of COVID-19 on the airline industry by creating a series of static, dynamic and interactive plots. The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. To visualise the impact that the pandemic has had on some major airports and international routes

2. Compare the impact of the pandemic on air traffic to previous crises in the airline industry such as the aftermath of the Eyjafjallaj√∂kull volcano eruption in April 2010.

3. Compare the impact that COVID-19 has had on commercial and private traffic 

4. To visualise the impact on vertical flight efficiency and taxi-out time


### Datasets used:

1. Crowdsourced air traffic data from The OpenSky Network 2020 - <https://zenodo.org/record/3974209#.X6uqfnUzbkt>
