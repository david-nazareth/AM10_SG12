# AM10 Final Project Proposal- Study Group 12

### Objectives of the project:

National lockdowns and government restrictions in response to COVID-19 grounded commercial airlines in many parts of the world in the first half of 2020. We aim to visualize the impact of COVID-19 on the airline industry by creating a series of static, dynamic and interactive plots. The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. To visualise the impact that the pandemic has had on some major airports and international routes

2. Compare the impact of the pandemic on air traffic to previous crises in the airline industry such as the aftermath of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano eruption in April 2010.

3. Compare the impact that COVID-19 has had on commercial and private traffic 

4. To visualise the impact on vertical flight efficiency and taxi-out time

### Results of the analysis:

1. Some of the longest and busiest air routes in the world saw flight volumes plummet compared to 2019’s numbers
2. The impact of COVID-19 has been much broader and deeper compared to the 2010 air traffic crisis and flight volumes have not yet recovered
3. Cessna overtook Airbus in terms of share in global air traffic for a brief while in 2020 as passenger flights came to a grinding halt
4. We can take comfort in knowing that the few flights which are still operational are able to taxi-out, take-off and land more efficiently due to clearer skies!
